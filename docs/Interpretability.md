# What is Explainable and Interpretable Machine Learning? 

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an emerging field... 

"Interpretation" in the context of TSInterpret refers to machine learning interpretability - i.e. making black-box algorithm decisions understandable to a user.
We refer to this with "interpretability" instead of explainability, as "explainability" is often seen as providing a good explanation in the sense of social science while "interpretability" only refers to visualizing/showing/approximating a model's inner workings.


-  "Interpretability is defined as the ability to explain or to provide the meaning in understandable terms to a human." [5]
-  "The ability to support user understanding and comprehension of the model decision making process and predictions"[6]


## Taxonomy 

This repo focuses on post-hoc interpretability.

## Simple Example Use Case 

Take for example a Decision Support System to classify heart rates as depicted in figure XXXX. While the data scientist knows that the machine learning model is able to obtain an accuracy of over 90 % to classify a heart rate as abnormal or normal, the decision process of such a system is still intransprent resulting in unsureness about the decision process of a model. A data scientist .... A model end-user ... 
To make this decision process more opaque a data scientist might decide to use algorithms for explainable and interpretable machine learning, to learn a) which features are important, b) which feature influence the decision of a model in a postive or negativ way?, c) how a counter example would look like ?.
